As part of a coursework project in college, I developed an online bookstore system. I was responsible for the design and implementation of the web application using ASP.NET Core MVC and Entity Framework. The goal of the project was to create a platform that allows users to easily search, browse, and
purchase books. The system included features for managing the book catalog,
shopping cart, and order processing.
Tech Stack: C#, ASP.NET Core MVC, Entity Framework, ORM, HTML/CSS, JavaScript

Home page - is the central location from which users can go to such pages as: Home, Catalog, Profile (Wish List, In Progress, Authorization/Registration, Settings, Coupons). It should be attractive, informative, and easy to navigate. On the main page, we will have the Popular and New categories. Popular shows the most relevant books that are highly rated. New shows the latest books from different authors that have gained popularity.
On the main page of the bookstore, you can find a powerful and convenient search tool that will help you quickly find the books or authors you need. The search bar is located in a prominent place and attracts your attention
Registration/Authorization - allows users to create accounts and access personalized features.
In Transit - allows users to view books that are in the process of being delivered. A brief information about the location and time of arrival will be written to keep the user informed about the order.
Favorites - will allow the user to save books that they want to buy but can't yet, or just so they don't forget.
Settings - will allow the user to make basic settings such as: “Change profile”, ‘Payment system’, ‘Accounts’, ‘Change profile’.

# Screen 1 - Home page.

Catalog - users can browse available books and search by various criteria. Users can filter and sort books by various parameters, such as genre, author, price, rating, and others. This allows users to customize the display of books according to their preferences.  Each book in the catalog should be presented with basic information such as title, author, publisher, cover, rating, and price. This helps users get a general idea of the book and make a decision about buying it.
Categories: Books in the catalog are organized into different categories, which helps you find books in a particular genre or topic. For example, the catalog may have categories such as Fiction, Science Books, Children's Books, Travel, Biographies, and many others.
Shopping cart - users will be able to add favorite books and manage their purchases before checkout. The shopping cart displays a list of books that the user has added to the cart. Each book can be presented with its cover, title, author, price, and other information.
Filters: Filters may be available in the catalog that allow you to narrow down your search results. You can use filters to select the author, publisher, language, year of publication, book format (hardcover or paperback), and other parameters.

# Screen 2 - Feedback section

The “Product information” section is an important part of a web-based bookstore application. In this section, users can get detailed information about a particular book they are interested in.
The product information page contains the main characteristics of the book, including its title, author, publisher, year of publication, genre, and a brief description of the content. In addition, users can see the book's cover, which helps them visually imagine what the book looks like.
